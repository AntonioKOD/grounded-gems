# Mobile Image Upload Fix

## Issue Description

The mobile app's image upload was appearing successful but images/videos were not being properly associated with posts. The uploads were successful to the media collection, but not linked to the post records.

## Root Cause

The mobile post creation API (`/api/v1/mobile/posts`) was incorrectly trying to create new media records from URLs instead of using the media IDs returned from the upload API.

### Original Flow (Broken):
1. Mobile app uploads image to `/api/v1/mobile/upload/image` ✅
2. Upload API returns `{id, url, filename, etc}` ✅
3. Mobile app sends post creation request with media URLs ❌
4. Post creation API tries to create new media records from URLs ❌
5. Media association fails ❌

### Fixed Flow:
1. Mobile app uploads image to `/api/v1/mobile/upload/image` ✅
2. Upload API returns `{id, url, filename, etc}` ✅
3. Mobile app stores media IDs and sends them in post creation request ✅
4. Post creation API uses media IDs directly to associate with post ✅
5. Media properly linked to post ✅

## Changes Made

### Backend API Changes (`sacavia/app/api/v1/mobile/posts/route.ts`)
- Updated validation schema to expect `media[].id` instead of `media[].url`
- Changed media processing logic to use existing media IDs instead of creating new records
- Added validation to ensure media IDs exist in database before associating
- Improved error handling and logging

### Mobile App Changes (`grounded-gems/components/post/CreatePostScreen.tsx`)
- Added `uploadedMedia` state to store media upload results with IDs
- Updated post submission to send media IDs instead of URLs
- Fixed reset logic to clear uploaded media state
- Added proper cache clearing after successful post creation

### Mobile App Service Updates (`grounded-gems/services/api.ts`)
- Added proper post creation method to mobile API service
- Updated response handling for post creation

## Additional Fixes

### CustomEvent Polyfill Issue
- **Problem**: React Native apps were showing "CustomEvent polyfill failed" error
- **Cause**: Test code trying to use browser's CustomEvent API which doesn't exist in React Native
- **Solution**: Removed unnecessary CustomEvent test from CreatePostScreen.tsx
- **Note**: App already uses DeviceEventEmitter for cross-component communication (proper React Native pattern)

### Video Component Migration
- **Problem**: expo-av Video component deprecated in favor of expo-video
- **Solution**: Successfully migrated all components from expo-av to expo-video
- **Components Updated**: MobileFeedPost, InstagramStylePost, VideoEditor
- **Result**: No more deprecation warnings, using modern video API

### CameraView Warning
- **Issue**: Warning about CameraView not supporting children
- **Status**: Expected behavior - overlay UI pattern is common and works correctly
- **Action**: No changes needed, warning is informational only

## Verification Steps

1. **Image Upload Test**:
   - Create post with image ✅
   - Verify image appears in post ✅
   - Check database shows proper media association ✅

2. **Video Upload Test**:
   - Create post with video ✅
   - Verify video plays in feed ✅
   - Check database shows proper media association ✅

3. **Post Creation Events**:
   - Create post ✅
   - Verify feed refreshes automatically ✅
   - Check DeviceEventEmitter events are firing ✅

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

All image and video uploads now work correctly with proper database associations. The mobile app successfully creates posts with media that appear immediately in the feed.

## Comparison with Web App

The web app works differently - it uploads files directly during post creation:

1. User selects files in form
2. Files are included in FormData for post creation
3. Post creation API processes files and creates media records
4. Media records are immediately associated with the post

The mobile approach is better for UX as it allows:
- Upload progress indicators
- Immediate preview of uploaded media
- Better error handling for individual uploads
- Ability to upload multiple files before post creation
