console.log('üé¨ Testing video upload fix...')

console.log('\nüìã Summary of the fix:')
console.log('1. ‚úÖ Enhanced form sends video files with formData.append("videos", file)')
console.log('2. ‚úÖ API route now properly separates File objects from string IDs')
console.log('3. ‚úÖ Video files are uploaded to Media collection first')
console.log('4. ‚úÖ Video IDs are then assigned to postData.video')
console.log('5. ‚úÖ Posts collection validation should now pass')

console.log('\nüîß What was fixed:')
console.log('- Issue: API route was treating File objects as pre-uploaded video IDs')
console.log('- Cause: formData.getAll("videos") returned mixed array of File objects and strings')
console.log('- Fix: Properly separate File objects from string IDs before processing')
console.log('- Result: Video files are now uploaded correctly before post creation')

console.log('\nüìù Expected flow now:')
console.log('1. User selects video file in enhanced form')
console.log('2. Form sends video file with formData.append("videos", file)')
console.log('3. API route detects File object in videos array')
console.log('4. API route uploads video to Media collection')
console.log('5. API route gets video ID from Media collection')
console.log('6. API route sets postData.video = videoId')
console.log('7. Post is created successfully with video')

console.log('\n‚úÖ Test completed!')
console.log('\nüì± Next steps:')
console.log('1. Try uploading a video in the browser')
console.log('2. Check console logs for proper flow')
console.log('3. Verify video appears in feed after upload')
