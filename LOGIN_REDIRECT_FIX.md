# Login Redirect Fix

## Problem
When users clicked on profile links while not logged in, they would:
1. Click "Profile" → Get redirected to `/login?redirect=/profile/[id]`
2. Log in successfully → Get redirected back to `/profile/[id]`
3. This could potentially create a cycle where users kept being bounced between login and profile

## Root Cause
The login form was respecting the `redirect` parameter and trying to send users back to the page they came from, including profile pages.

## Solution
Modified the login redirect logic to **always redirect to `/feed`** after successful login, regardless of the redirect parameter.

### Changes Made

**File: `components/LoginForm.tsx`**
```typescript
// Before
const safeRedirectPath = useMemo(() => {
  const currentPath = typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.pathname : ''
  
  // Use the utility to get a safe redirect path
  return getSafeRedirectPath(redirectPath, '/feed')
}, [redirectPath])

// After  
const safeRedirectPath = useMemo(() => {
  // Always redirect to feed after login, regardless of the redirect parameter
  // This prevents redirect loops and provides a consistent login experience
  return '/feed'
}, [])
```

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Redirect Loops**: No more bouncing between login and profile pages
2. **Consistent UX**: Users always land on the feed after login, which is the main app experience
3. **Simplified Logic**: No complex redirect path validation needed
4. **Better Mobile Experience**: Mobile users get a predictable post-login destination

## Profile Access
- Profile viewing remains **completely public** - no authentication required
- Users can visit any profile page without logging in
- Only profile **editing** functions require authentication (edit, dashboard, etc.)
- The middleware correctly handles this distinction

## User Flow After Fix

1. **Unauthenticated user clicks profile link** → Can view profile immediately (no redirect to login)
2. **User clicks login from any page** → After login, always goes to feed
3. **User clicks restricted profile actions** (edit, dashboard) → Redirected to login → After login, goes to feed

This ensures a smooth, predictable experience while preventing redirect loops.
