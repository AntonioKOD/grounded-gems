   - ✅ Upload progress indicators
   - ✅ Category selection (exterior, interior, food & drinks, etc.)
   - ✅ Caption and tagging functionality
   - ✅ Upload to `/api/media` endpoint
   - ✅ Submit to `/api/locations/[id]/photo-submissions` endpoint

3. **HEIC Converter** (`lib/heic-converter.ts`)
   - ✅ Complete HEIC to JPEG/PNG conversion
   - ✅ Dynamic loading to prevent SSR issues
   - ✅ File size optimization
   - ✅ Quality preservation
   - ✅ Error handling and user feedback

### 🌐 **API Endpoints Verified:**

1. **Media Upload** (`/api/media/route.ts`)
   - ✅ Authentication required
   - ✅ File validation and size limits
   - ✅ HEIC file support
   - ✅ Creates media documents in PayloadCMS

2. **Photo Submissions** (`/api/locations/[id]/photo-submissions/route.ts`)
   - ✅ Authentication required
   - ✅ Photo quality assessment
   - ✅ Creates submission records for review
   - ✅ Handles user permissions properly

3. **Collection Schema** (`collections/LocationPhotoSubmissions.ts`)
   - ✅ Complete schema for photo submissions
   - ✅ Quality scoring fields
   - ✅ Review workflow (pending → reviewing → approved/rejected)
   - ✅ Category and tagging support

### 📦 **Dependencies & Libraries:**

1. **HEIC Support:**
   - ✅ `heic2any` library installed (v0.0.4)
   - ✅ Proper dynamic imports for client-side usage
   - ✅ Browser-only execution (no SSR issues)

2. **File Upload:**
   - ✅ FormData handling
   - ✅ Progress tracking
   - ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages

### 🎯 **User Experience Features:**

1. **Authentication Integration:**
   - ✅ Shows "Add Photo" button only for logged-in users
   - ✅ Seamless user authentication via `useAuth` hook
   - ✅ User profile data (name, avatar) displayed in modal

2. **Quality Feedback:**
   - ✅ Real-time quality scoring (resolution, file size, format)
   - ✅ Immediate feedback on photo selection
   - ✅ Guidelines for good photo quality

3. **Upload Progress:**
   - ✅ Progress indicators during upload
   - ✅ Success/error toast notifications
   - ✅ Modal auto-closes on successful submission

## 🚀 **How It Works:**

1. **User clicks "Add Photo"** → PhotoSubmissionModal opens
2. **User selects image file** → HEIC conversion (if needed) + quality check
3. **User adds caption/category** → Form validation
4. **User submits** → Upload to media collection → Create submission record
5. **Success feedback** → Modal closes, photos refresh

## 🔄 **Review Workflow:**

Photos go through a review process:
- **Pending** → Initial submission state
- **Reviewing** → Under admin/moderator review  
- **Approved** → Appears in location gallery
- **Rejected** → User notified with feedback
- **Needs Improvement** → User can resubmit

## ✅ **Build Status:**
- **Build**: ✅ Successful (Exit code: 0)
- **TypeScript**: ✅ No type errors
- **Dependencies**: ✅ All required packages installed
- **API Routes**: ✅ All endpoints working

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**
The photo upload system is ready for use! Users can now:
- Upload photos to location pages when logged in
- Convert HEIC files automatically
- Add captions and categorize photos
- See quality feedback in real-time
- Track upload progress

The system is production-ready and follows modern web development best practices.
