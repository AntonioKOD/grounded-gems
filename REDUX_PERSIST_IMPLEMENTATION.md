# Redux Persist Implementation ✅

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of Redux Persist in the Sacavia application to ensure that user state (including saved posts) persists across page reloads and browser sessions.

## Problem Solved

**Issue:** When users saved posts and then reloaded the page, the saved state would be lost because Redux state is ephemeral and resets on page reload.

**Solution:** Implemented Redux Persist to automatically save and restore Redux state to/from localStorage.

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Redux Persist Installation**
```bash
npm install redux-persist
```

### 2. **Store Configuration (`lib/store.ts`)**

#### Key Changes:
- **Client-Side Only Persistence:** Redux Persist only works on the client side, so we conditionally create the persisted reducer
- **Selective Persistence:** Only `user` and `posts` slices are persisted; `feed` is excluded to ensure fresh data on reload
- **Proper Middleware Configuration:** Added Redux Persist actions to the serializable check ignore list

```typescript
// Create persisted reducer only on client side
const createPersistedReducer = () => {
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    const storage = require('redux-persist/lib/storage').default
    const persistConfig = {
      key: 'root',
      storage,
      whitelist: ['user', 'posts'], // Only persist user and posts state
      blacklist: ['feed'], // Don't persist feed state as it should be fresh on reload
    }
    return persistReducer(persistConfig, rootReducer)
  }
  return rootReducer
}
```

### 3. **Store Provider Updates (`app/StoreProvider.tsx`)**

#### Key Changes:
- **PersistGate Integration:** Wraps the app with PersistGate to handle rehydration
- **Loading State:** Shows a loading spinner while Redux state is being rehydrated
- **Per-Store Persistor:** Creates a persistor instance for each store instance

```typescript
return (
  <Provider store={storeRef.current}>
    <PersistGate loading={<LoadingSpinner />} persistor={persistorRef.current}>
      {children}
    </PersistGate>
  </Provider>
)
```

### 4. **API Route Fix (`app/api/posts/[postId]/save/route.ts`)**

Fixed Next.js 15 compatibility issue where `params` must be awaited:

```typescript
export async function POST(
  request: NextRequest,
  { params }: { params: Promise<{ postId: string }> }
) {
  const { postId } = await params
  // ... rest of the implementation
}
```

## What Gets Persisted

### ✅ **User State (`user` slice)**
- User authentication data
- User profile information
- Login status

### ✅ **Posts State (`posts` slice)**
- `likedPosts`: Array of post IDs the user has liked
- `savedPosts`: Array of post IDs the user has saved
- Loading states for interactions

### ❌ **Feed State (`feed` slice) - Excluded**
- Feed posts are not persisted to ensure fresh content on reload
- Pagination state resets on reload
- Filters and sorting preferences reset

## How It Works

### 1. **State Persistence**
- When Redux state changes, Redux Persist automatically saves the whitelisted slices to localStorage
- The state is serialized as JSON and stored under the key `persist:root`

### 2. **State Rehydration**
- On app startup, Redux Persist checks localStorage for saved state
- If found, it deserializes and restores the state to Redux
- PersistGate prevents the app from rendering until rehydration is complete

### 3. **User Experience**
- **First Load:** Normal app loading
- **Subsequent Loads:** Brief loading spinner while state rehydrates, then app renders with preserved state
- **Saved Posts:** Remain saved across page reloads and browser sessions
- **Login State:** User remains logged in across sessions (until token expires)

## Storage Location

Redux Persist uses `localStorage` by default:
- **Key:** `persist:root`
- **Location:** Browser's localStorage
- **Scope:** Per domain/origin
- **Persistence:** Until manually cleared or browser data is cleared

## Benefits

### ✅ **Improved User Experience**
- Saved posts persist across page reloads
- User doesn't lose their interaction state
- Faster perceived loading (state available immediately)

### ✅ **Reduced Server Load**
- Less need to refetch user interaction data
- Cached state reduces API calls

### ✅ **Offline Resilience**
- User can see their saved posts even when offline
- Interaction state preserved during network issues

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Save a post and reload the page - saved state persists
- [x] Like a post and reload the page - liked state persists
- [x] Login and reload the page - user remains logged in
- [x] Clear localStorage and reload - app works normally
- [x] Multiple browser tabs maintain consistent state
- [x] State rehydration completes before app renders

## Browser Compatibility

Redux Persist uses localStorage, which is supported in:
- ✅ Chrome 4+
- ✅ Firefox 3.5+
- ✅ Safari 4+
- ✅ Edge 12+
- ✅ iOS Safari 3.2+
- ✅ Android Browser 2.1+

## Debugging

### View Persisted State
```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.getItem('persist:root')
```

### Clear Persisted State
```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.removeItem('persist:root')
```

### Redux DevTools
- Redux Persist actions appear in Redux DevTools
- Look for `persist/REHYDRATE` action on app startup
- State shows `_persist` metadata

## Future Enhancements

### 1. **Selective Field Persistence**
Could be configured to persist only specific fields within slices:

```typescript
const persistConfig = {
  key: 'root',
  storage,
  whitelist: ['user', 'posts'],
  transforms: [
    // Only persist specific fields
    createTransform(
      (inboundState: any) => ({ savedPosts: inboundState.savedPosts }),
      (outboundState: any) => outboundState,
      { whitelist: ['posts'] }
    )
  ]
}
```

### 2. **Encryption**
For sensitive data, could add encryption:

```typescript
import { encryptTransform } from 'redux-persist-transform-encrypt'

const encryptor = encryptTransform({
  secretKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PERSIST_KEY,
  onError: (error) => console.error('Encryption error:', error)
})
```

### 3. **Migration**
For schema changes, could add migration logic:

```typescript
const persistConfig = {
  key: 'root',
  storage,
  version: 1,
  migrate: createMigrate({
    1: (state: any) => {
      // Migration logic for version 1
      return { ...state, posts: { ...state.posts, newField: [] } }
    }
  })
}
```

## Conclusion

Redux Persist successfully solves the state persistence issue, ensuring that user interactions (especially saved posts) are maintained across page reloads and browser sessions. The implementation is robust, handles SSR properly, and provides a smooth user experience.
